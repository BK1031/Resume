            \item Added new services to the Admin Gateway (the backend powering Admin UI) using Python and FastAPI, and deployed on AWS Fargate
            \item Created a Service Registry Browser to visualize and provide easy access to information on the hundreds of services deployed on AWS, dependencies between services and on datastores were automatically generated nightly from AWS CDK config files
            \item Created an On-call Log to track on-call events for each engineer and each team, tag and search through previous actions taken, and send slack workspaces notifications to relevant engineers/teams when an on-call event is triggered

        \begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt, leftmargin=10pt]
            \item Spearheaded the creation of the Data subteam, and the development of Mapache, a robust data aquisition and analytics system allowing real-time concurrent data analysis on multiple vehicles
            \item Data from over 200 sensors are sent over CAN (Controller Area Network) to a Jetson Orin Nano, where edge ML models perform error/anomaly detection in real-time
            \item These signals are all sent over MQTT to an ingest service deployed on AWS, where data is deserialized and stored in a SingleStore database
            \item Queries are performed on SingleStore to analyze driver behavior, vehicle performance, and other metrics relevant to the team, helping find areas of improvement for the car's design
            \item A dashboard created with React and Typescript allows the team to view data in real-time, as well as analyze performance across different vehicles, sessions, and laps
